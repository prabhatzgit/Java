#OOPS

OOPS contains two parts 1. Principles, 2. Techniques

1. Principles : 

* Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Coupling and Cohesion

2. Techniques :

* Abstraction, Method hiding, coding through abstraction, coding through interfaces

* In Java everything can be represent as a form of object.

Class VS Object

* Class is a logical entity contains the logic of the application.

* Class is a blueprint and it decides object creation and without class there is no object.

* declare the class using class keyword.

* Object is a physical entity representing memory.

* every object occupies its own memory

* create the object using new keyword

#Object

* Every object has three values -- 1. state, 2. Identity and Behaviour

* State -- variable declaration

* Identity -- number assignement

* Behaviour -- methods which contains logic

#Inheritance:

* The process of aquiring properties from one class to another class is called inheritance.

* It uses extends operator to acquire properties. extends keyword is used to make the relationship between two classes.

* It is also known as IS-A relationship.
